 meditation. It looked as if Lord Arunachala did not wish him to remain for more than six weeks in the place where he attained jnana. Lord Buddha attained jnana after living in a forest for six years and doing penance day and night. It is that place which is known as Buddha Gaya and is now a place of pilgrimage. In the case of Ramana Bhagavan, however, he attained jnana without any effort in an ordinary house in a narrow lane in the centre of a city and in a small room surrounded by all his relatives.
