 had been already completed with the floor also fully cemented, and the old ugly parapet wall of the well had been removed and in its place a fine looking parapet wall erected. The steps leading from the eastern verandah of Bhagavans hall to the quadrangle and the new shed on the north have been considerably improved and beautified. Further, a temporary shed, contiguous with the new northern shed, has also been put up to provide sitting accommodation to the crowds that are expected on the 1st. I found Bhagavan seated at the western end of the new shed, on a stone platform. Mr. C. Madhavaraya Mudaliar (my brother in law) and myself prostrated ourselves. Bhagavan asked, You have just come? How did you come; and who else? I replied, I came by train up to Katpadi, arriving there about 12 noon. From thence I went to Vellore and took the bus and have arrived here just now. There was no difficulty at all about travelling. I and my brother in law alone have come now. But Kotiswaran and his wife will come tomorrow evening.
