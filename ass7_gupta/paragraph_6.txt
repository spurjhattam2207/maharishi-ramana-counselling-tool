 I returned here last night. Maha Vir Prasad, Chief Engineer to the U. P. Government who had been staying here for about twenty days in October and November and who went on a pilgrimage to Rameswaram and other places, is back here. In continuation of an old question of his with reference to a certain passage in Maha Yoga, he asked Bhagavan whether it was necessary and a condition precedent for a man to watch his breathing before beginning the mental quest Who am I?
