 A devotee brought and gave to Bhagavan a cutting from The Bombay Chronicle in which an account was given of how Ramana Jayanti was celebrated this year at Matunga, Bombay, by the Ramana Satchidananda Sangh and how one Vijayaraghava Bhagavatar of Mannargudi and his party performed an excellent kalakshepam on Bhagavan and his life and teachings. The cutting was read out in the hall for the benefit of all. It said that a harikatha was held on Ramana. Bhagavan said, Harikatha on Ramana is a misnomer. Kalakshepam would have been more appropriate.
