('29', 58, 4, 7, 120773) We have spoken so much today that it would not, I feel, be wrong if in deference to Sarojini Devis advice I hold my tongue.
('29', 58, 4, 8, 120897) There is, however, one difficulty in doing so.
('29', 58, 4, 9, 120944) I have left my weapon at home.
('29', 58, 4, 10, 120975) If I had brought it, I would have given you an object lesson and asked you to take a wheel and start spinning along with me.
('29', 58, 4, 11, 121100) I had no idea that I would receive this advice today from Sarojini Devi, or that it would be my lot to listen to so much praise.
('29', 58, 4, 12, 121229) I am tired of listening to praise.
('29', 58, 4, 13, 121264) Believe me when I say that I do not like this praise.
('29', 58, 4, 14, 121318) But I shall not say more on this subject just now.
('29', 58, 4, 15, 121369) I shall only say that I feel bound to those who have praised me and I request them all, as did Shri Jayakar, to help me by their silence.
('29', 58, 4, 16, 121507) I shall be able to take up heavy responsibilities if I have your silent support.
('29', 58, 4, 17, 121588) Before I say something, I wish to elicit atonement from one or two persons.
('29', 58, 4, 18, 121664) Before we attend any meeting, we must learn good manners.
('29', 58, 4, 19, 121722) We should know and respect the disposition of our guest.
('29', 58, 4, 20, 121779) If you cannot do this, it is better that you do not attend the meeting.
('29', 58, 4, 21, 121851) Two or three persons have violated this etiquette of a meeting.
('29', 58, 4, 22, 121915) What Bhai Jamnadas 2 said was literally true.
('29', 58, 4, 23, 121961) Much dirty work has been done in the shadow of Mahatma.
('29', 58, 4, 24, 122017) The word Mahatma stinks in my nostrils; and, in addition to that, when somebody insists that everyone must call me Mahatma I get nausea, I do not wish to live.
('29', 58, 4, 25, 122177) Had I not known that the more I insist on the word Mahatma, not being used, the more does it come into vogue, I would most certainly have insisted.
('29', 58, 4, 26, 122325) In the Ashram where I live, every child, brother and sister has orders not to use the word Mahatma.
('29', 58, 4, 27, 122425) None should refer to me as Mahatma
