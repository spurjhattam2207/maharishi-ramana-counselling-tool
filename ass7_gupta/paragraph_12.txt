 I again asked Bhagavan about the Nachiketa fire. I find from the Kathopanishad that there was already a fire sacrifice which was supposed to lead one to heaven. After Yama explained it to Nachiketas as the second boon, he voluntarily said, Hereafter this fire will be called the Nachiketa fire, after you. But later, the Nachiketa fire is mentioned as three fires. I dont understand what this fire is and why it is called three fires. Thereupon, Bhagavan asked us to look up the commentary and we took out Krishna Prems Kathopanishad and Bhagavan read out the portion concerned. He added, Everything is allegorical. They gave out truths only in this way, never straight out in a simple and direct manner. The same fire has three branches or flames, and so is called one fire or three fires. But both the one fire and the three branches are allegorical, the fire standing for something and the branches for other things. The commentary says that the one central fire has to be kindled on the three planes, bhu, bhuvar, and suvar, or the physical, astral and mental planes.
