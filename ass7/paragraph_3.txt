 and took it away from me and carefully kept it with him. He was very young at that time. Some time afterwards, I wrote down that same sloka. I was sitting on a big stone slab near the Ashram and all gathered round me and wanted me to tell them the meaning of the sloka. I acquiesced and explained it to them for some two or three hours. Taking advantage of this, Jagadisa recently wrote a long commentary on it in the same style as had been done on a sloka of Sankaras. The manuscript has apparently been lost somewhere. When Nayana2 wrote the Ramana Gita, he took this sloka as the opening sloka for the second chapter. That is the whole story. I have not written anything unless for a good reason.

But there is an interesting thing about it. In 1913, he asked me some questions and learnt something.
