 me, I was in the Virupaksha Cave. Thereafter he came off and on; quite a number of times I should think. Later on he took to sannyasa, went to the south on a pilgrimage, reached Courtallam in due course and then became a big swamiji. He established a peetam (a monastery with temple) there. Rajagopala Iyer said, He is reported to have acquired many siddhis (occult powers). Is that a fact? Yes, It seems he was making gold and showing it to others, said another devotee. Bhagavan kept quiet even though he was hearing all that was being said. For some days thereafter devotees continued discussing the same matter amongst themselves in the presence of Bhagavan. One day, a devotee remarked, It seems disputes have arisen over the ownership and control of the peetam and its properties in Courtallam. Another devotee replied, Yes, Yes. Disputes have arisen. It seems the deceased swami made out a Will saying that only an Andhra Niyogi brahmin should succeed as mathadhipathi (the head of the peetam). The Tamilians disputed it saying, After all it was we Tamilians who have donated the properties to the peetam and so we should have the right to decide about the succession. The matter has gone to court. What! to the court? exclaimed Rajagopala Iyer and looking at Bhagavan, said, This matter has gone to court even though there is a Will! With a smile Bhagavan said, Yes. It is so. What else will happen if property is accumulated? Will not this also (meaning the Ramana Ashram) go to court? Folding his hands with great humility, Iyer remarked, We have a Will, dont we? Yes sir, Yes. There is a Will. First Chinnaswami, then Venkattu and thereafter Sundaram, and so on, should manage according to the Will. What of that? Will not this too go to court? So saying Bhagavan resumed silence.
