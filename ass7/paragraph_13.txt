 carefully. I wanted to stitch a small book of white paper and paste them all in. I mentioned this to Bhagavan now and then but he always said, Why bother? Yesterday afternoon, I was bent upon pasting them and so when I requested him, he said, Why? If all of them are in one place, someone or other will take it away finding that it contains all Swamis writings. We cant say anything. Swami is the common property of all. It is better to leave them separate. I then understood the real reason why Bhagavan was unwilling and so gave up my attempt. In the meantime, a fussy young man who had recently come, asked, Swami, it seems a Jnani has jnanadrishti (supernatural vision) besides bahyadrishti (external vision). Will you please do me the favour of giving me that jnanadrishti? Or will you tell me where there is a person who could give it to me? Bhagavan replied, That jnanadrishti must be acquired by ones own effort and is not something that anybody can give. That devotee said, It is said that the Guru himself can give it if he so pleases.

A Guru who is a Jnani is only a guide but the walking (i.e. the sadhana) must be done by the sishyas themselves. The young man felt disappointed and went away. A little later, a devotees child of about five or six years of age, residing in Ramana Nagar, brought two raw fruits from their garden and gave them to Bhagavan. She used to bring sweets and fruits now and then and give them to Bhagavan. On all such occasions, Bhagavan used to say, Why all this? But he ate them all the same. Yesterday, he gave them back without eating and said, Take this fruit home, cut it into small bits and give them to all the others saying, This is to Bhagavan, this is to Bhagavan and you also eat some. Bhagavan is within everybody. Why do you
