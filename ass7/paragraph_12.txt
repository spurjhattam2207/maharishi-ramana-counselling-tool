 Dr. S. Rao said, The Self realised ones could not possibly differ among themselves and the leaders of the various schools, if they were Self realised men, could not have said anything contradictory to each others teachings. But their followers must have misunderstood or misinterpreted their teachings in such a way as to lead to all these schisms and latter day quarrels. Dr. S. Rao said that, while he was at Salem, a gentleman often quoted to him a verse from Saint Nammalvar in which the Alwar describes the deity at Tirupati as both Vishnu and Siva.
