 A visitor, an old devotee of Bhagavan, had brought with him a book called Ramanopakhyanam by one Thangavelu Nadar. I imagined from the title that the book dealt with Bhagavans life and teachings. But Bhagavan told me it contained only the stanzas found in some nadi horoscope of Bhagavan, with the notes or commentary of a gentleman who was then editing a Tamil paper. He added that, besides this version, some other nadi versions of Bhagavans horoscope have been traced and sent to the Asramam by different devotees. I thereupon remarked, But it is said these so called nadi horoscopes are not all quite correct on all points! Bhagavan said, Various people in various parts of the country claim to have various nadis. We dont know. This Thangavelu Nadar was originally at Kumbakonam. There used to be one at Tindivanam. When anybody went to him, he used to tell them, You must go and have darshan of Ramana Maharshi, at such and such a time. The same is indicated in the nadi horoscope;
